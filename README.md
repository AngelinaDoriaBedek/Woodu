# Woodu | web store for handcrafted jewelry

This is a design for a web store inspired by a small handmade jewelry making business.\
The web shop is designed to highlight products, give the customers the ability to browse and take a closer look at product details.

The goal of this project is to create a responsive design that focuses on user experience rather than the functionality of an e-commerce website.
